Login feature with flashed messages:

The login feature uses Flasks login_user to remain logged in after user crediants are validation, which sets a session cookie containing the user's ID. Also using Werkzeug's security module to verify the user's salted passwords. 😃

## RESTful API - 066 

Created a RESTful API for a mock up coffee shop location database from scratch using Flask, and SQLAlchemy. Complete with full documentation provided by PostMan. If the database cannot find information or wrong information is inputted the API will handle these request effectively with the appropriate responses.

Using GET requests you can search for specific or all information in the database:

## Strapi Blog Project - 59

With my markdown files converted I setup a flask app that loads the most recent 25 posts from my Strapi CMS via its API. It's pretty much a fully functional blog site for now, but the markdown isn't displayed correctly, will fix that with a later update when I am making a final version to display all of my everythings on it.

![Flask Bootstrap testing blog](assets/bootstrap-blog-01.png)

## Jekyll Markdown Data Migration - 58

I needed blog posts for a Flask app I am working on so I created a script to handle the migration of my jekyll markdown files to my Strapi CMS I have setup. 

![Eww files](assets/data-migrator3.png)

Uses frontmatter to extract the information from the markdown files on my PC, such as all of the tags and categories, then handles the posting of the information to Strapi. This way I can populate my new blog. I'm working on setting up user authentication so I can make the flask app into a frontend for that connects to the Strapi API.

## Zillower Home Price Data Collector - 53

Zillow stores its home information by latitude/longditude, so we can enter in coordinated lat/long of where you want your home prices. So we start the program by asking for the user to input desired filename for data storage locally as well as the desired coordinates:

![User inputs latitude/longitude](assets/zillow01.png)

The program will then scrape all listings for the desired area, then ask you for a google form link to input all of the data to:

![User inputs latitude/longitude](assets/zillow02.png)

The program will then use selenium to input all of the gathered data into the google form.

![Selenium filling out google forms](assets/zillow03.png)

We can then create a new google spreadsheet and manipulate the data further however we want! Sky is the limit.

![Data stored in google sheets](assets/zillow04.png)

Pretty cool project to complete really good practice.

## Amazon Price Scraper/Low Price Messager - 47

This program will take an amazon URL, and use beautifulsoup to collect information such as current available price its name, the price you want to be notified at, and connect to my Strapi API to hold the information. 

![Price Scraper Tracking New Item](assets/amazon_price_scraper01.png)

You can list all of the items you are currently tracking:

![Price Scraper List all items](assets/amazon_price_scraper02.png)

Check amazon to see if there are updated prices, then update all prices in the database:

![Price Scraper update item prices](assets/amazon_price_scraper03.png)

And finally, run a price scan, out an an email if there are any deals.

## Top100 Billboard Spotify Playlist Creator

## Flight Deal Finder 

Communicates with a [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) instance that I installed on an ubuntu VM. This program connect with Strapi to collect the locations of places you would like to visit and how much you will be willing for looking to spend on a flight. It will then connect to Kiwi's Tequila API to check and see if there are flights available for lower than your set price. If there are the program can be setup to either email or SMS you. Unfortunately most email and SMS software costs money now, so for now it just prints a message. I have setup SMTP servers on my home PC but they are unable to send emails outside of the network.

TODO - Work on UI - Create user inputs and then user creation
