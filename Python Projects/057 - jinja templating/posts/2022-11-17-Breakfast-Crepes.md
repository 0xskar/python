# Thin Breakfast Crepes

- Prep 10 min
- Cooking 25 min
- ~8 large 10" crepes

##  Ingredients

- 1 cup (150 g) all-purpose flour
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 eggs
- 1.5 cups (375ml) milk
- 1.5 tsp (2.5ml) vanilla extract
- 1tbsp unsalted butter, melted
- more butter for cooking

##  Directions

In a bowl, combine flour sugar and salt. Whisk in eggs, 1/2 cup milk, vanilla extract, until smooth. Gradually add in remaining milk, stirring constantly. Whisk in the melted butter.

Make sure the pan is hot - warmed up medium high and turn down to adjust to temp if too high. When hot, brush with butter. Burning butter is too hot.

Each crepe pour ~4tbsp of batter into the center of the pan, quickly and gently move pan around to distribute the batter. While still wet we can replace any holes or add more batter for a perfect circle. 

Wait to see edges forming around crepe and poke to see if lose to flip when perfect golden.

For each additional crepe add a smol knob of butter beforehand.

Add fruit, syrup, powdered sugar and enjoy!
