## Spectrograms

A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time. When applied to an audio signal, spectrograms are sometimes called sonographs, voiceprints, or voicegrams. When the data is represented in a 3D plot they may be called waterfalls. 

- Download the file and open it in Audible as the hint says.
- After some clicking around viewing as Spectrogram gives us our anwser
