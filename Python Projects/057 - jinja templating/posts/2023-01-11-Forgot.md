## Nmap Scans

We star off like usual by adding the forgot.htb to our `/etc/hosts` and with an nmap scan

```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```

```bash
sudo nmap -p- -T4 forgot.htb -vvvv
```

> I also like to open up [cherrytree](https://www.giuspen.net/cherrytree/) here and create a map with information that I gather through the enumeration process. Then we can keep the tree flowing. I find it makes it easiar to keep track of discoveries this way. For this machine there are only 2 open ports but for other machines we come accross there can be many, many services to enumerate.
{: .prompt-info }

For example we have two ports discovered through `nmap` and using another nmap scan to find the services we can add that information to the tree.

```bash
sudo nmap -sC -sV -O -p22,80 forgot.htb
```
